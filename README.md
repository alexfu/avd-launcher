# avd-launcher

Launch an Android Virtual Device without Android Studio.

## But why?

We can already launch AVDs without Android Studio by using the `emulator` command.

```
$ emulator -avd avd_name
```

This CLI tool does nothing more than wrap the above command and provides an easier way to interface.
